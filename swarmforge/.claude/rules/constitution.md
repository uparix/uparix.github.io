# Swarmforge Constitution

This document is the unbreakable law for every agent in the swarm.  
All agents (Architect, Coder, Tester, Reviewer, etc.) MUST obey these rules on every task, every file, and every commit. Violations are automatically rejected.

## Core Principles

- We produce **clean, reliable, maintainable, and scalable** software.
- Discipline is enforced by the swarm itself — never by hope or manual review.
- Speed without quality is forbidden. Quality without speed is inefficient.

## Rule 1: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

- **Always write tests first.** Never write or modify production code until there is at least one failing test that describes the desired behavior.
- Follow the Three Laws of TDD strictly:
    1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
    2. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is enough to fail (and not compiling is failing).
    3. You are not allowed to write any more production code than is enough to pass the one failing unit test.
- After the test passes, refactor the code (and tests) while keeping all tests green.
- The agent must show the Red → Green → Refactor cycle clearly in its reasoning and output.
- No production code may be committed without accompanying tests written first.

## Rule 2: End-to-End (E2E) Tests with Gherkin Interpreter

- Every user-facing feature or significant behavior change MUST be described first in a business-readable Gherkin file using Given-When-Then format.
- The swarm maintains and uses its own Gherkin interpreter that automatically converts .feature files into executable E2E/functional tests.
- The interpreter parses the Gherkin scenarios and generates runnable test code (language-agnostic execution via the platform's test runner).
- All Gherkin scenarios must pass before any feature is considered complete.
- Production code changes that affect behavior are forbidden unless the corresponding Gherkin scenarios are updated and passing.
- Gherkin files serve as the single source of truth for expected system behavior.

## Rule 3: Cyclomatic Complexity and CRAP Score Enforcement

- Every method/function must have cyclomatic complexity ≤ 4.
- CRAP (Change Risk Anti-Patterns) score for every method must be < 30.
- The Simplicity Enforcer agent runs static analysis on every change.
- If any method exceeds the limits:
    - The change is rejected.
    - The swarm must refactor (extract methods, simplify logic, apply patterns such as Strategy, State, or Command) until the metrics pass.
- Refactoring must preserve behavior (verified by existing tests and mutation testing).
- Goal: Keep the codebase simple, readable, and easy to maintain as the swarm scales.

## Rule 4: Mutation Testing

- Mutation testing is mandatory on every non-trivial change.
- The Mutation Hunter agent must:
    - Identify conditionals, operators, boundaries, and logical expressions in the changed code.
    - Generate mutants by making small semantic changes (e.g., true↔false, >↔<, &&↔||, boundary ±1, negate conditions, etc.).
    - Run the full test suite against each mutant.
    - If a mutant survives (test suite still passes), the build fails and the swarm must:
        - Generate a new failing test (or update an existing one) that kills the mutant.
        - Ensure the new test follows Rule 1 (TDD) and Rule 2 (Gherkin where applicable).
- Target: Achieve ≥ 90% mutation kill rate on changed code before merging.
- Surviving mutants are treated as critical defects.

## Rule 5: Linter Enforcement (Static Code Quality)

- All code must pass the configured language-specific linter with zero warnings or errors.
- The Linter Guardian agent runs the linter automatically on every file change or before commit.
- Common violations that are explicitly forbidden:
    - Unused imports/variables
    - Inconsistent naming conventions
    - Missing or incorrect documentation/comments on public APIs
    - Magic numbers or hardcoded values (replace with named constants)
    - Deeply nested code blocks (max two levels of nesting)
    - Functions longer than 30 lines (encourage extraction)
    - Inconsistent formatting or style
- The swarm must auto-fix safe issues where possible; otherwise, it must explain and apply the fix manually while still obeying Rules 1–4.
- Zero-tolerance: The swarm accepts no code until the linter reports clean.

## Enforcement Mechanism

- Every agent reads this Constitution at startup and includes it in its system prompt.
- Pre-commit and pre-merge hooks in SwarmForge automatically run:
    - TDD verification
    - Gherkin interpreter + E2E tests
    - Mutation testing
    - Complexity/CRAP analysis
    - Linter
- Any violation causes the entire task or commit to fail with a clear explanation.
- The swarm is authorized (and required) to reject, refactor, or request clarification from the human user if a requested change would violate any rule.

## Amendment Process

- Changes to this Constitution require explicit approval from the human maintainer (Justin Martin) and must be documented with version history.
- All agents will be restarted with the new version after the amendment.

Disciplined agents build better software — faster and more reliably.
